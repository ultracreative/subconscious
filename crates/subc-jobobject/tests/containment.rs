//! Containment tests: a grandchild must not outlive teardown.
//!
//! These are the evidence for the fix. The failure they defend against is a
//! module whose helper process survives the module: on this machine the Synapse
//! embedding module's CUDA worker holds ~2.2 GB of VRAM, so a leaked grandchild
//! is a leaked GPU allocation, and a day of restarts compounds it.
//!
//! Every assertion names a **pid**, not "the job is empty". A test that only
//! checked the job's own count would pass against a job that was never populated
//! and against a tree that leaked but was never assigned.
