# Refuse a change to a cross-repo crate's code that does not move its version.
#
# Seven repos in this fleet consume these crates BY RELATIVE PATH -- broca,
# engram, claustrum, callosum, astrocyte, insula, synapse -- so they float to
# whatever this repo's HEAD is. A path dependency is recorded in a consumer's
# Cargo.lock as a bare version string with NO source and NO checksum, so
# `cargo build --locked` over there cannot see that the code moved. Two cases:
#
#   version moved     -> the consumer's --locked build FAILS until they take it
#   version unchanged -> the new code is silently compiled in, lock byte-identical
#
# The second is the common one and there is no signal anywhere. Measured on this
# repo when the hazard was found: subc-protocol had 5 source commits in 30 days
# and 0 version bumps. Nothing broke, because those changes happened to be
# additive -- which is luck, not a mechanism.
#
# DOC-ONLY CHANGES ARE EXEMPT DELIBERATELY. Three of those five commits were
# doc comments. A rule that fires on prose gets ignored on substance, so this
# asks whether the OUTPUT can move, not whether a file did -- the same
# discriminator a corpus regeneration check uses.

# by hand. CI never sees it because CI checkouts are clean, which is how it
