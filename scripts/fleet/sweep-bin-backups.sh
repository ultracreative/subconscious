# Sweep placement snapshots left beside live binaries in the deploy bin.
#
# Four naming conventions from different eras coexist there
# (`ck-<m>.rollback-<UTCZ>`, `ck-<m>.bak-<stamp>`, `ck-<m>.pre-<version>`,
# `ck-<m>.<version>.pre-<thing>`), so the rule is deliberately prefix-blind:
# for each `ck-<binary>`, keep the TWO NEWEST `ck-<binary>.*` files by mtime
# and unlink the rest. place-module.sh writes its rollbacks into STAGING,
# not here, so nothing in bin/ is a current recovery path; the two kept per
# binary are for the placements other seats ran by hand.
#
# A manifest (sha256, size, mtime, name) is written before the first unlink.
# Reports the df delta, not the sum of unlinked sizes.
#
# On 2026-09-20 this directory held 275 snapshots / 3.6 GB, and every one was
# an executable `ck-*` on PATH that `ck` domain discovery probed once with
# `--ck-domain` (fixed in ck 0.20.7 by refusing dotted names as candidates).
#
# Usage: sweep-bin-backups.sh [--dry-run]
