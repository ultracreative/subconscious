//! Blue/green swap of one supervised module.
//!
//! A swap starts a CANDIDATE process beside the running INCUMBENT, routes
//! nothing to it while it warms, and once it has declared itself ready moves new
//! routes onto it and drains the incumbent. The sequence, and why each step is
//! shaped the way it is, is `docs/designs/module-readiness-and-swap.md`
//! ("Rung 3").
//!
//! Two rules run through everything here:
//!
//! * Until cutover the incumbent is the module. Nothing on a failure path may
//!   drain it, touch its snapshot, move its nonce, or spend a unit of its
//!   crash-restart budget. A candidate that fails is killed, its slot is freed,
//!   and the swap reports which arm failed; the module is exactly as it was.
//! * The candidate is reached only by connection or by endpoint, never by
//!   module id, because every by-id lookup resolves the incumbent.
//!
//! The whole swap runs inside the module's supervise loop, like a restart, and
//! the incumbent is not health-probed while it runs. But the candidate's warm-up
//! can take the whole readiness budget, so it keeps serving the module's
//! commands meanwhile (see [`serve_command_while_warming`]): an operator stop,
//! disable or retire aborts the swap and is then carried out on the incumbent,
//! instead of queueing for up to the budget. The operator's reply is sent at
//! cutover or failure, before the incumbent's drain, so a caller whose own
//! requests ride the incumbent is not left waiting on a drain that is waiting
//! on it.
