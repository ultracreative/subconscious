# EVERY REFUSAL PRINTS THE SAME PREFIX: "REFUSED: ". There were two vocabularies
# until 2026-09-18 -- lowercase "refusal:" from argument validation, uppercase
# "REFUSED:" from the gate arms -- and a caller filtering output with
# `grep -E "...|REFUS"` saw NOTHING when a path was wrong, because the arg-
# validation path used the other spelling. An empty filter result reads as
# quiet success, so a real refusal became invisible at the exact moment the
# operator most needed it.
#
# THE RULE THIS ENCODES: the party that knows the outcome must NAME it, because
# every downstream filter is guessing at a vocabulary. A caller's grep is an
# allow-list over outcomes and inherits the allow-list defect -- the outcome
# nobody anticipated is the one that goes silent. Corollary for readers: prefer
# a position-based view (`tail`) over a pattern-based one for verdicts, since a
# verdict you failed to predict still occupies the last line.

# THE INVARIANT THIS SCRIPT DEFENDS, STATED ONCE, EXECUTABLY NOWHERE YET:
#
#     THE THING BEING VERIFIED IS THE THING THAT WILL RUN.
#
# Every arm below is an INSTANCE of a way that sentence can be false: PATH
# resolving to a different file than the one placed; a sidecar describing
# another file; a rollback verified against itself; a marker counted in the
# wrong table; a text file that is not an executable at all. Not one of the arms
# says the sentence.
#
# BROCA's diagnostic (2026-09-19) is why that matters and it is uncomfortable:
# A GUARD THAT CATCHES STRANGERS IS DEFENDING AN INVARIANT; A GUARD THAT KEEPS
# CATCHING THE PERSON WHO WROTE IT IS COMPENSATING FOR ONE NOBODY HAS WRITTEN
# DOWN. At least three of these arms have refused MY OWN cards. I had read that
# as the gate working -- and it is, which is exactly what keeps the tell quiet:
# a gate that never fires is obviously untested and gets examined, while a gate
# that keeps catching its author reads as vigilance and gets praised.
#
# So this header is a statement of intent and a standing TODO, not a claim of
# coverage. The arms are load-bearing and each one is here because it caught a
# real defect; what is missing is a check of the sentence itself, which would
# make the next novel falsification route fail by name instead of sailing past
# five arms that were each written for a different one. If you add an arm here,
# ask BROCA's question first: what else is the same shape and would NOT be
# caught by the arm I am about to write?
#
# Place a staged module binary with every gate arm that has caught a real defect.
#
# Each arm exists because it failed once, and each failure was a TRUE statement about
# the wrong object rather than a missing check:
#   which          a --version read from the file you placed is true about that file,
#                  while PATH resolves an older one the operator actually runs
#                  (ck-models, 2026-09-14: new CLI on disk at a path nothing resolves).
#   sidecar verify a rollback nobody can verify is not a rollback, and an incident is
#                  the wrong moment to find the sidecar was written for another file.
#   marker + control  a discriminator that reads 0/0 proves nothing (it may have been
#                  dead-code-eliminated); a control that reads 1/1 proves the reader works.
#   inode          proc-vs-disk is the only proof the restarted process runs these bytes;
#                  `cp` in place preserves the inode and makes the check a tautology,
#                  so placement is always copy-to-tmp then atomic mv.
#   warm-exec      macOS first-exec assessment is per-inode and does not transfer from
#                  the staging path, so it must run on the destination before the restart.
#
#
# CUTTING THE DAEMON ON macOS: `bootout` IS A RESTART, NOT A STOP, AND IT REPORTS
# TWO FAILURES WHILE SUCCEEDING (measured 2026-09-20 on this desk).
#
#   plist   KeepAlive = SuccessfulExit, RunAtLoad = true
#   daemon  the SIGTERM handler exits 0 BY DESIGN, so supervised children observe
#           EOF on their control socket and run their own teardown instead of
#           being SIGKILLed by a dropped Tokio runtime
#
# So `launchctl bootout gui/<uid>/cortexkit.subc` sends SIGTERM, the daemon exits
# SUCCESSFULLY, and KeepAlive relaunches it before bootout can finish removing the
# job. bootout then reports `3: No such process` and a following `bootstrap`
# reports `5: Input/output error` (already loaded). BOTH ERRORS ARE ARTIFACTS OF
# RACING launchd'"'"'S OWN RELAUNCH; the cut worked, and the log shows the announced
# drain followed ~1s later by `subc daemon starting`.
#
# WHY THIS IS WORTH WRITING DOWN RATHER THAN REMEMBERING: a command that reports
# failure while succeeding trains the operator to ignore its output, and the next
# time it reports failure while FAILING the message will read the same. Verify a
# cut by the daemon'"'"'s own evidence -- a new pid, inode proc == disk, and the
# `subc daemon starting` line after the drain -- never by launchctl'"'"'s exit code.
#
# To genuinely STOP the daemon (not restart it), the job must be disabled first,
# because a clean exit is exactly what KeepAlive=SuccessfulExit revives.
#
# Usage:
#   place-module.sh --module <id> --staged <path> [--dest <path>] [--path-face <name>]
#                   --marker <string> [--control <string>] [--old-control <string>]
#                   [--no-restart]
#
# Refuses (exit 2) before touching the destination if any pre-arm fails.
#
# MUTATION REQUIRES --place. The default runs every arm and stops before the first
# side effect, because a tool that places by DEFAULT is one distracted invocation
# from placing when you meant to test it -- which happened on 2026-09-15. The
# default should be the one that is safe to be wrong about.

# ---- CURRENCY: is this the artifact its OWNER says is live? ----
#
# TWO MECHANISMS, AND ONE OF THEM IS AUTHORITATIVE.
#
#   ck-<module>.current   a manifest the module's owner writes when they hand
#                         over a card: "<sha256>  <filename>  <UTC stamp>".
#                         It STATES a fact. Authoritative.
#   newest-by-mtime       this gate INFERS from file ordering. A fallback, and
#                         a poor one -- the directory accumulates leftovers, so
#                         the newest file may be stale too.
#
# They agreed the first night the manifest existed (broca 0.3.98). THAT
# AGREEMENT IS EXACTLY WHEN TO DECIDE WHICH ONE WINS, rather than treating
# concord as validation and discovering the ordering at the moment they
# disagree -- which would be a placement, with an operator waiting.
#
# So: manifest present -> it decides, and the mtime arm is not consulted at all.
# Manifest absent -> mtime, and the line SAYS it is inferring, because a
# fallback that reads like a verdict is how a guess becomes a fact.
#
# Measured 2026-09-18, which is why any of this exists: 84 staged binaries across
# all modules, 26 for broca alone with verifying sidecars, every one passing this
# gate's only placeability test. A broca card was superseded upstream hours after
# it was staged and gated, and I learned it from its owner rather than from here.
# TWO DECLARATION SHAPES, AND THE ROOT-LEVEL ONE IS STRICTLY STRONGER.
#
#   <stage>/ck-<module>.current   in-stage. "<sha256>  <file>  <stamp>".
#   <staging root>/<module>.current   beside the stages, key=value, carrying
#                                     stage= and revision=.
#
# An IN-STAGE manifest can only say "this stage is current", because to read it
# I must already have chosen a directory -- so it is a SELF-ATTESTATION, and
# every stage can carry one saying yes. It catches the case where I pass a stale
# directory that has no manifest, and misses the case where the stale directory
# has one. The ROOT-LEVEL form NAMES the current stage, which is the question the
# mtime fallback was guessing at.
#
# FUSI built the root form (2026-09-19) after my gate printed "INFERRED from
# mtime" on one of their cards; PLEX and three others already write the in-stage
# form. Both are read, root first, because a seat that improved its declaration
# must not be punished for it and a seat that has not must keep working.
# TWO STAGING LAYOUTS EXIST AND NEITHER IS WRONG, so the declaration is looked
# for in BOTH plausible places and parsed by CONTENT rather than by location.
#
#   PER-STAGE DIRECTORY (fusiform, broca)   ~/ck-stage/fusiform-<stamp>/ck-fusiform
#       -> the root is the PARENT of the artifact's directory
#   FLAT, SHA-SUFFIXED FILES (plexus)       <staging>/SIGNED.ck-plexus.<sha>
#       -> the artifact's directory IS the root
#
# Deriving only "parent of the artifact directory" looked one level too high for
# the flat layout and found nothing. Measured against plexus 2026-09-19: the
# lookup landed on ~/.local/share/cortexkit/plexus.current, which does not exist,
# so the gate fell through to the in-stage arm and refused a CORRECT artifact
# with a message naming the wrong cause.
#
# FORMAT IS DECIDED BY CONTENT, NOT BY PATH. A file containing `stage=` is the
# key=value form; anything else is the older positional `<sha> <file> <stamp>`.
# Deciding by location is how a seat that adopts the better format at the old
# filename gets its correct declaration parsed as garbage -- which is exactly
# what happened when PLEX rewrote ck-plexus.current in the new shape.

# reads "staged N / live N" and the gate refuses the MARKER, naming the build when the
# fault is the reader. That refusal is indistinguishable from a genuinely stale stage.
#
# A needle present only on the live side cannot pass unless the live read genuinely
# reached the OLD file, so marker (staged-only) plus this (live-only) is a two-way
# proof through one instrument. The natural pick is the marker's own SUPERSEDED

# of asserting arrival and departure separately.
