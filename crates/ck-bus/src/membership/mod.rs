//! Agent durables (spec ruling R15): prefrontal owns where each agent resides, and it
//! creates, removes and reads each agent's durables through ops on ck-bus's management
//! surface. ck-bus accepts them only from `reserved:prefrontal-core`; any other caller,
//! a `Direct` one included, is refused `ckbus_caller_not_permitted`.
//!
//! An agent has one durable, `consumer_name(agent_id)` (`c_{agent_id}`), on each of the
//! three agent streams: WAKE (filter `wake_fire(agent)`), PEER (`peer_filter(agent)`) and
//! EFFECT (`effect_filter(agent)`). Every name and filter comes from the naming crate.
//!
//! - `ckbus.agent_durable_bind {agent_id}` creates the three durables with every limit
//!   stated. An existing durable with the same configuration is reported `created:
//!   false`; one with a different configuration is refused by name and left as it is.
//!   A refusal on one stream leaves the others as they are, and a retry converges.
//! - `ckbus.agent_durable_delete {agent_id}` deletes the three durables and purges the
//!   agent's subjects from their streams, so its undelivered messages are gone and a
//!   later bind does not deliver them again. An absent durable is not an error.
//! - `ckbus.agent_durables_list` reports one row per durable on an agent stream, with
//!   `pending` the server's count of messages the durable has not delivered yet.
//! - `ckbus.agent_effects_pending {agent_id}` reports the agent's EFFECT durable's
//!   `undelivered` and delivered-but-unacked (`in_flight`) intents, and `pending` as
//!   their sum. In-flight intents count because a merge deletes the durable and purges
//!   its subject, so an intent mid-claim whose claimant then naks would be lost. The
//!   server keeps an intent that exhausted `max_deliver` in flight until it is termed
//!   or acked, or until the durable delivers another message, so an exhausted intent
//!   its claimant never termed holds a merge back until then or until an operator
//!   acts. Prefrontal reads this before a merge.
//!
//! Merge is not a ck-bus op, and no stream-to-stream copy runs anywhere: prefrontal
//! decides a merge in its own store, where the message bodies live, and then calls
//! `ckbus.agent_durable_delete` for the source agent. Nothing in ck-bus assumes a copy.
//!
//! The pull grant on any agent durable is a whole-token `*` in the consumer position on
//! the three agent streams, so no consumer other than an agent's `c_{agent_id}` may ever
//! exist on them. `CKBUS_OWNED_DURABLES` lists the consumers ck-bus itself owns, and its
//! test holds them off the agent streams.
