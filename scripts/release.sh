# release.sh — tag and push a per-crate subconscious release.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/release.sh <crate> <version> [--dry]
#   e.g. ./scripts/release.sh subc-transport 0.1.0
#
# Publishable crates: subc-protocol, subc-transport (subc-core is publish=false).
# On the pushed tag, CI (release.yml) takes over: verify (fmt/clippy/test on
# ubuntu + windows) → cargo publish to crates.io.
#
# NOT three platforms, despite what this said until 2026-07-26: ci.yml's matrix
# is ubuntu and windows only. macOS is absent because Blacksmith has no macOS
# runners and GitHub-hosted macOS is billing-blocked for this private free-plan
# org -- the same constraint that leaves .github/workflows/subc-fed.yml queued
# forever. So a release is verified on two platforms and SHIPS a darwin-arm64
# asset built by scripts/release-darwin-binaries.sh on the dev box, which is the
# one platform combination CI cannot check.
