//! The spawn-stream consumer: ck-bus follows the supervisor's spawn events and ends the
//! credential of every process that exits.
//!
//! Facts come from the daemon (`source`): `supervisor.spawn_snapshot`, the live processes
//! with their spawn generations and the cursor they were observed at, and
//! `supervisor.spawn_subscribe`, every spawn and exit after a cursor. Generations are the
//! supervisor's; ck-bus never counts them.
//!
//! - An `exited` event revokes the module's census credential when the entry is at that
//!   generation or an earlier one (every exit, whatever its cause: the event carries no
//!   reason on purpose). An entry at a later generation belongs to a respawn and is left
//!   alone. A `spawned` event does nothing: a live generation with no census entry is
//!   issued lazily, on the child's first `ckbus.credential`, because ck-bus has no channel
//!   to push a credential.
//! - Reconciliation lists the census, then takes a snapshot, then revokes every entry
//!   whose (module, generation) the snapshot does not list. The census is read first so
//!   that an entry written after the listing (issuance only writes for a generation that
//!   is live) is never judged against an older snapshot, and each revocation re-checks
//!   that the entry is still at the generation that was listed. It runs at start, after
//!   every gap in the stream, and every `RECONCILE_PERIOD`.
//! - The last processed cursor is kept in `spawn_cursor.json` (`cursor`). At start the
//!   consumer reconciles and then resumes from that cursor, so exits during its own
//!   downtime are replayed. A missing or damaged file resumes from the snapshot instead.
//! - A cursor the daemon refuses (another daemon incarnation, or older than its ring)
//!   means events were missed that can never be replayed: the consumer reconciles
//!   against a fresh snapshot and subscribes from that snapshot's cursor. A stream the
//!   daemon drops for lagging is also a gap: the consumer reconciles, then resubscribes
//!   from the last cursor it received (and falls back to the snapshot if that cursor is
//!   refused in turn). Any other end of the stream resubscribes the same way.
//!
//! Revocation itself belongs to the revocation area (`census` drives its `Revoker`);
//! a revocation that defers keeps its durable record and the area retries it. ck-bus's
//! own module is skipped: its previous box users are revoked by bootstrap, by name.
//!
//! Absence is neutral: a census or snapshot read that fails concludes nothing and is
//! retried after the consumer's `retry` interval (the sentinel period in production).
