//! The dead-letter consumer: ck-bus reads `CK_{ACCT}_EFFECT_DEAD` through its durable
//! `c_ckbus_dead` and records each dead-lettered message once per message id.
//!
//! Terminal disposition is the job of the claimant: the module that pulled (claimed) an
//! effect item from `CK_{ACCT}_EFFECT` under its own credential. JetStream's delivery cap
//! only stops redelivery and publishes nothing, so when the claimant sees an item
//! exhaust its deliveries it publishes a dead-letter record to `ck.{acct}.effect.dead`
//! and only then calls `term()` on the original item. That order means a crash can
//! produce a duplicate record but never a lost one: a crash between the two leaves the
//! record stored and the item unterminated, and the next claimant publishes the same
//! record again. The stream drops a republish that carries
//! the same `Nats-Msg-Id` inside its duplicate window; a republish outside that window
//! is stored as a second message. ck-bus therefore deduplicates here, on the record's
//! own `message-id` field.
//!
//! What "recorded" means. The durable record is the stream message itself: the claimant
//! waited for the server to store it before terminating the item, so a terminated item
//! always has a stored record. ck-bus's record of it is one `ckbus.dead_letter.recorded`
//! line naming the message id and the stream sequence of the FIRST stored record for
//! that id. Every later stored record with the same id is a
//! `ckbus.dead_letter.duplicate` line naming both sequences. ck-bus settles (acks) a
//! record on `c_ckbus_dead` only after its line is written, so a record is never
//! settled unrecorded.
//!
//! Which record is first is a function of the stream alone, so the answer survives a
//! restart without a file of its own; `docs/specs/ck-bus-module.md` lists every shape
//! ck-bus's durable store may hold, and none is for dead letters. At
//! every start ck-bus reads how far the previous `c_ckbus_dead` had settled (its ack
//! floor), saves that floor in `c_ckbus_dead_checkpoint`'s metadata, then deletes and
//! recreates the consuming durable from the first retained record. The checkpoint is
//! never deleted, so an interrupted recreation retains the settled floor. Replaying the
//! stream rebuilds the ledger of first sequences; records at or below the old ack floor
//! were recorded by an earlier process and are settled again without a line. A process
//! that dies after writing a line and before settling the record writes the same line
//! (same message id, same sequence) again after the restart: a repeat of one record,
//! never a second record for the id.
//!
//! The module spec's health answer names no dead-letter state, so this consumer adds
//! nothing to `health.check`; its failures are `ckbus.dead_letter.down` lines.
