# macOS module privacy identity

On macOS every supervised module, including `protocol: "none"` programs and
blue/green swap candidates, becomes its own responsible process. This is a
behaviour change: Screen Recording, Accessibility, Files and Folders, Local
Network and Full Disk Access prompts name the module, and grants previously
given to `ck-subc` no longer reach modules or their agent shells. There is no
config opt-in, exception or opt-out. Linux and Windows launch behaviour is unchanged.

The supervisor still uses its single Tokio Command path, including environment,
stdio, process group, kill-on-drop and the final fd-3 launch-nonce handoff. On
macOS its program is the explicit privacy trampoline with hidden first argument
`__disclaim-exec`. Before any runtime, logging or configuration, the trampoline
uses Darwin `posix_spawnp` with `POSIX_SPAWN_SETEXEC` and the dynamically resolved
private `responsibility_spawnattrs_setdisclaim(&attr, 1)`. SETEXEC replaces the
image in place: the pid, group, pipes and non-CLOEXEC nonce descriptor survive.
No `POSIX_SPAWN_CLOEXEC_DEFAULT` flag is added. The nonce handoff explicitly
clears close-on-exec, including when its original descriptor is already fd 3.

## Fail closed and executable identity

At startup the supervisor probes its explicit trampoline once. It must resolve
the responsibility symbol and print the capability string `subc-privacy-trampoline/v1`. A missing
symbol or wrong binary produces one ERROR; the daemon keeps serving `ck`, but
each module launch refuses with the named cause. Each trampoline also resolves
the symbol independently. Lookup, attribute setup and spawn failures write a
short tagged refusal record with the named cause to the acknowledgement pipe,
print one stderr line and exit with reserved codes 120–123. Exit status alone
never identifies a refusal: a real module can return any of those codes.
**Never fall back to ordinary
exec:** that would silently give a module the daemon's grants again.

A separate acknowledgement pipe has its write descriptor above fd 3 and stdio.
It survives the first exec; the trampoline makes it CLOEXEC for SETEXEC. The
parent drops its writer immediately after spawn. The asynchronous child monitor
reads through EOF within five seconds. A tagged nonempty record names a refusal;
empty EOF acknowledges exec. If the module already exited, no image is admitted
and its ordinary exit/restart classification remains unchanged. Otherwise the
monitor compares the kernel image's device/inode with the resolved executable.
The supervisor refuses a missing or mismatched image, kills the fresh process
group, and records the named spawn failure under the usual restart budget. A
script retains the existing orphan-identity rule: the kernel's selected
interpreter image is recorded, but the trampoline image is never accepted.
A script module's privacy identity is its interpreter's, so a script needing
permission should be shipped as a signed binary.

Before confirmation the shutdown roster owns the pid but records no executable.
Orphan cleanup cannot signal such an unverified record. After confirmation it
records the module, never the transient `ck-subc` image. This preserves the
existing synchronous Supervisor API without blocking a Tokio worker on the
acknowledgement. Normal shutdown can still end an unconfirmed child it owns.

Status, provenance and resource reporting use the same confirmation boundary:
the optional module pid stays absent and the running-image probe reports
`not_running` until acknowledgement and image validation succeed. Spawn time and
other launch metadata remain available. A refusal never publishes a module pid.
Provenance pairs its pid and image from one status read so confirmation cannot
split those observations. Internal shutdown, process groups and restart
accounting continue to own the real pid from spawn. The spawn/exit feed reports
physical process facts (including refused launches); status and provenance
report a confirmed module, not the intermediate trampoline.

Embedded macOS daemons must explicitly call
`Supervisor::with_privacy_trampoline` (or `BootstrapConfig::with_privacy_trampoline`)
with the `ck-subc` executable or another binary whose `main` calls `subc_os::privacy_identity::trampoline_main`
before any runtime. The library never assumes an arbitrary host executable
implements this protocol. Missing configuration refuses by name.

## Signing and operator visibility

Privacy grants follow the module's code signature. Modules requiring permissions
must be signed with a stable team identity: ad-hoc signing has no stable developer
identity, so every rebuild prompts again. A long-lived, team-signed disclaimed
process can obtain Local Network permission and retain it across reruns (measured
2026-10-05). macOS names a process for a privacy prompt only while it is still
running, so a short-lived probe is never prompted and is not evidence that a
module can't be granted.

Each confirmed spawn logs INFO with module_id and pid:
`module spawned with own privacy identity (responsibility disclaimed)`.
Refusals log WARN with their cause; the trampoline's stderr also enters the
module capture log. Supervisor diagnostics never pollute the child's own output.
`ck module logs <id>` exposes these facts. `supervisor.list` does not report
identity yet: adding a field to `SupervisorEntry` breaks every consumer that
builds it with a struct literal, so the field waits for a breaking
`subc-control` release. That release should also make `SupervisorEntry`
`#[non_exhaustive]` with a constructor, so later additions do not force another
fleet-wide source break. Status does not claim that pending disk
configuration is the identity of a currently running process.

Existing daemon releases ignore unknown per-module config keys rather than
rejecting them. This change adds no per-module configuration key, so no config rollout ordering is needed.
