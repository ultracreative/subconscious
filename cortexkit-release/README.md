# cortexkit-release

`cortexkit-release` is the Rust package for the `ck-release` binary. It drives
declared release trains through validation, planning, approval, durable replay,
and verified staging. Repository declarations are data in
`.cortexkit/release.jsonc`; they never provide executable release code.

## Machine boundary

Production durable state has one ruled root:

```text
~/.local/share/cortexkit/release/<repository-id>/<train>-<intended-commit>.journal
```

The associated append-only intent stream, approval record, and leases live
below that same root. `ck-release` never writes its journal into the release
repository and never reads or emits provider credentials.

The first public trigger is an explicit approval boundary. The machine renders
the complete approval subject—repository, train, intended commit, declaration
digest, artifact identities and digests, release version or run ID, and the
ordered public-effect list—before it can admit a public effect. A material
change requires a new approval. `plan --dry-run` and `status` do not acquire
release credentials or invoke providers.

There is deliberately no `place` command and no `place` phase. A successful
train ends at verified staged artifacts and emits placement instructions for
the separate operator-owned fleet ceremony. Placement, restart, inode checks,
and behavioural acceptance remain outside `ck-release`.

## Commands and machine output

Every command supports `--json`. Its output is a versioned envelope with a
stable refusal code and exit status `2` for an unsafe or invalid request.
Automation must branch on `error.code`, not diagnostic text.

```text
ck-release declare [--repo PATH]
ck-release validate [--repo PATH] [--train TRAIN]
ck-release plan --train TRAIN --dry-run --artifact ID=PATH [--repo PATH]
ck-release execute --train TRAIN --artifact ID=PATH [--confirm-first-public-trigger]
ck-release resume --train TRAIN --artifact ID=PATH
ck-release status --train TRAIN [--repo PATH]
ck-release abandon TRAIN [--repo PATH]
ck-release rebind TRAIN [--repo PATH]
ck-release rebind TRAIN --confirm DIGEST [--repo PATH]
```

`rebind` first displays a structural declaration diff. Supplying the exact
replacement digest on a later invocation is the explicit confirmation that
re-pins the declaration and invalidates earlier approval state. A digest
mismatch on `resume` instead refuses and names `abandon` and `rebind` as the
available operator ceremonies.

The `--synthetic-provider` and `--interrupt-after-effect` options are for the
hermetic synthetic train exercised by this package's tests. They are not a
production provider implementation. The synthetic interruption makes the fake
effect durable, returns before the completion append, and then proves `resume`
uses the done-probe to append completion without a second executor call.

The CLI currently executes `gates_local` and the six declared precheck detectors.
Other non-public phase names (`preflight`, `ci_watch`, `build`, `stamp`,
`verify_readback`, `stage`, and `notify`) are valid planning vocabulary but are
not wired to the CLI runner. Executing them refuses with `phase_not_implemented`
instead of reporting a successful gate or fabricating evidence. The synthetic
provider demonstrates public-effect replay, not real CI, builds, readback, or
staging; the walkthrough below describes the intended complete pipeline.

`verify_readback` is observational and may follow an irreversible phase.
`ci_watch` remains a pre-publication gate even if its selector names a tag;
watching CI after publication would need a separate watcher role, which is not
yet defined. Any phase that can refuse and stop the train (a gate such as
`ci_watch`, `build` or a precheck) must be placed before the first irreversible
phase (`tag`, `publish` or `assets`); a plan that orders one after it is
refused with `unsafe_phase_ordering`.

`publish` and `assets` accept optional `params.artifacts` arrays of declared
artifact IDs. Omitting the list targets all artifacts. Lists must be non-empty,
unique, and contain only declared IDs. Publication phases in one train must have
disjoint targets, so a train using both phases must explicitly partition its
artifacts. Kinds remain opaque; the planner never guesses an upload destination
from an artifact's kind.

## Acceptance-baseline walkthrough mapping

The normative acceptance baseline records one manual sequence: publish an
asset, verify it, stage it with the intended revision, then hand it to the
separate placement ceremony. The following is a 1:1 mapping of those manual
steps to machine phases and output boundaries.

| Manual baseline step | Machine phase or boundary | Machine evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Publish the finalized asset | `publish` or `assets` | Write-ahead intent, approval subject, and done-probe evidence |
| Verify the published asset | `verify_readback` | Phase completion plus identity-matching probe conclusion |
| Stage the verified asset | `stage` | Verified staged-artifact terminal state |
| Confirm the intended revision | Artifact identity channel and the train's `intended_commit` | Identity evidence in the plan, probe, and approval subject |
| Hand off for live-fleet placement | Terminal placement-instructions boundary | `placement_instructions`; no machine-owned action follows |

The final row intentionally maps to an emitted instruction rather than a
phase: the manual placement, restart, inode verification, and behavioural
acceptance are operator work and are not reported as machine completion.
