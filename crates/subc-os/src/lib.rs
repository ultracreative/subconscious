//! Operating-system primitives the subc daemon needs and cannot reach without
//! unsafe code, each behind a small safe API.
//!
//! The daemon crates forbid unsafe code. This crate is the one deliberate
//! exception (like `subc-uptime` and `subc-cgroup`): every `unsafe` block here
//! is a single foreign call with its preconditions stated beside it, and nothing
//! unsafe is exported.
//!
//! Today it answers one question: is the process now holding pid N the same
//! process the daemon spawned earlier? A pid alone cannot say, because the
//! kernel reuses pids once a process has been reaped. [`Process`] reads the two
//! facts that tell processes apart, the kernel's start time for the pid and the
//! file identity (device and inode) of the executable image it runs, and sends
//! signals to it.
//!
//! Sources, per platform:
//!
//! - Linux: the start time is field 22 of `/proc/<pid>/stat` (clock ticks since
//!   boot), and the executable is `stat` through `/proc/<pid>/exe`, which
//!   resolves to the running image even if its file has since been replaced or
//!   deleted. A pidfd is opened before either is read and signals go through it
//!   (`pidfd_send_signal`), so the process that was checked is the process that
//!   is signalled. No unsafe code is needed: rustix wraps both calls.
//! - macOS: the start time is `kp_proc.p_starttime` from `sysctl`
//!   `KERN_PROC_PID` (microseconds since the epoch), and the executable is the
//!   path `proc_pidpath` reports, then `stat` on that path. These two calls are
//!   the crate's only unsafe code. macOS has no pidfd, so a signal is a plain
//!   `kill` sent right after the checks; see [`Process::signal`].
//! - Anywhere else: [`Process::open`] reports [`std::io::ErrorKind::Unsupported`].
//!
//! It also reads how much memory and CPU time one process is using, for
//! reporting only; see [`resource_usage`]. On Linux that is procfs again; on
//! macOS it is `proc_pid_rusage`, plus `mach_timebase_info` to convert its CPU
//! times to nanoseconds, the other two unsafe calls in the crate.
