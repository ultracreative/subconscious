//! Windows job-object containment for supervised subc module children.
//!
//! A supervised module may spawn helpers of its own — the Synapse embedding
//! module spawns a CUDA worker that holds the GPU allocation — and until this
//! crate existed nothing in teardown took them. `Child::kill` is `TerminateProcess`
//! scoped to one pid, and Windows has no process group to signal, so a module
//! that was terminated rather than asked could not close its own pipes and its
//! grandchildren outlived it. A day of restarts accumulated orphans.
//!
//! A job object contains by **membership** rather than ancestry, which covers the
//! two cases a `taskkill /T` walk cannot:
//!
//!   * a grandchild spawned between the walk and the kill;
//!   * a grandchild whose parent has already exited and been reparented, so it is
//!     no longer in the tree to be found. Those are precisely the orphans that
//!     accumulate across restarts.
//!
//! # The suspended-create contract
//!
//! [`suspend_on_create`] and [`resume_main_thread`] exist because assignment must
//! happen before the child can run a single instruction. `CreateProcess` gives the
//! caller no way to place a process in a job atomically short of building the
//! process by hand with `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_JOB_LIST`, so the child is created
//! suspended, assigned, and then resumed. A window between spawn and assignment
//! is a grandchild that escapes — the defect this crate fixes, in smaller form.
//!
//! The order is load-bearing and there are exactly three steps:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # #[cfg(windows)]
//! # fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
//! let job = subc_jobobject::JobObject::new()?;
//! let mut command = std::process::Command::new("module.exe");
//! subc_jobobject::suspend_on_create(&mut command);
//! let child = command.spawn()?;
//! job.assign(&child)?;
//! subc_jobobject::resume_main_thread(child.id())?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! # #[cfg(not(windows))] fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! [`spawn_contained`] performs all three for the synchronous case. A caller that
//! spawns asynchronously sets the flag, spawns, calls [`JobObject::assign`], and
//! resumes — which is what the daemon's `contain_spawned_child` does.
//!
//! If the caller never resumes, the child stays suspended forever, so
//! [`resume_main_thread`] reports the failure rather than logging it: the caller
//! must kill the child and fail the spawn.
