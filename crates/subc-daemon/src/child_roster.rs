//! Every supervised process this daemon has spawned and not yet reaped, and the
//! daemon's own end-of-life stop for them.
//!
//! Each supervised module runs in its own process group (see
//! `spawn_child_in_slot`). That keeps a service manager's process-group kill
//! from reaching modules before they see EOF on their control connection, but
//! it also means nothing outside this daemon will end a child that outlives it.
//! A `protocol: "none"` child (the NATS server) has no control connection and
//! never sees EOF at all; left alone it would survive the daemon as an orphan
//! and the next daemon would start a second one that fights it for its port.
//! So the daemon ends its own children on the announced-shutdown path, and this
//! roster is how it finds them: the child handles themselves are owned by the
//! per-module supervisor tasks, which keep reaping them while shutdown runs.
