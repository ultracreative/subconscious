/**
 * Design-approved gate for contributor pull requests.
 *
 * The rule: a pull request is reviewable and mergeable only once the issue it
 * closes carries a maintainer's `design-approved` label. GitHub has no native
 * "issue first" setting, so the rule is assembled from two primitives — this
 * script's exit code (surfaced as a required status check) and the pull
 * request's draft state.
 *
 * Parsing and decision logic live in this script rather than inline in the
 * workflow so they can be unit tested with no network (design-gate.test.mjs).
 * The workflow only supplies the event payload and the tokens.
 *
 * Two tokens, and which call uses which is the point: the `design-gate` check
 * run goes out on the workflow's own GITHUB_TOKEN (CHECK_TOKEN), everything
 * else on the app token (GITHUB_TOKEN). See `runPullRequestGate`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/design-gate.mjs pull-request   # decide, comment, exit 0/1
 *   node scripts/design-gate.mjs issue-labeled  # release drafts waiting on an issue

 * Draft conversion and commenting are best-effort — a fork pull request runs
 * with a read-only token and both will be refused. The returned conclusion
 * never depends on them: a side step that fails must not turn a failing gate
 * green.
 *
 * Publishing the check run is NOT best-effort, because it is the gate's
 * output rather than a side effect of it. Branch protection requires the
 * check named `CHECK_NAME`, and that name belongs to this script: the job
 * status a workflow reports is named after whatever the calling repository
 * happened to call its job, so making that the required name would put a
 * caller's job id into the branch-protection contract. A sha that never
 * receives this check run is blocked with nothing in the run list to explain
 * it, so a refused publish has to be loud.
 *
 * That is why the check run goes out on `checkApi` and nothing else does.
 * `checkApi` is built from the workflow's own token, which the calling job
 * grants `checks: write` in a file anyone can read; `api` is built from an
 * app token, whose installation permissions can only be read back with the
 * app's own credentials. The step that decides whether a pull request is
 * blocked must not depend on a permission nobody running the gate can check.
 * Both clients are passed in rather than chosen here, so this function stays
 * free of tokens: the split lives at the edge, in `main`.
