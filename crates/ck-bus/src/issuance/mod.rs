//! Issuance: a supervised participant asks ck-bus for its bus credential.
//!
//! ck-bus serves three ops over the subc wire, `ckbus.credential`, `ckbus.nonce_sign` and
//! `ckbus.credential_renew`. Every user JWT expires 15 minutes after it is signed;
//! renewal re-signs the same key with a fresh `exp`, and the holder renews before the old
//! one lapses. All three
//! authorize by the principal the daemon stamped on the caller's route at bind time
//! and by nothing the caller writes in its request: `Principal::Reserved { module_id }`
//! (the caller presented its launch nonce) binds the answer to that module id and to the
//! live spawn generation the supervisor's spawn snapshot shows for it. A body field
//! naming another module id is ignored. Any other principal is refused
//! `ckbus_principal_direct`, and a module with no live generation
//! `ckbus_generation_not_live`.
//!
//! The census key is the module's entry in the account's census bucket
//! (`AccountNames::census_key`, value in `census`): it names the credential the module
//! currently holds, and revocation reads it to find the key to revoke. Issuing and
//! writing the census key are one act, in this order:
//! 1. fence against the spawn snapshot's generation;
//! 2. advance and fsync the generation's entry in `epoch_high_water.json`;
//! 3. generate the user key in memory and have the box account root (the vault key
//!    that signs every user JWT in the box account) sign its JWT;
//! 4. (retired: issuance no longer creates agent durables; prefrontal creates them
//!    through `ckbus.agent_durable_bind`, in the membership area);
//! 5. write the census key;
//! 6. answer.
//!
//! A failure (or a crash) before step 5 leaves a signed JWT whose seed is dropped and no
//! census entry, so there is nothing to roll back; the next request issues at a higher
//! epoch. Once an issue completes, the module's previous user is superseded: its key is
//! dropped from memory (so a reconnect under it gets `ckbus_credential_superseded`). Its
//! revocation is recorded durably by the replacement guard (a [`CensusReplacement`]
//! the revocation area installs) after signing and before the census write. The census
//! entry is the only record naming the old key, so recording it first means a crash
//! during the overwrite cannot lose it. If the census write then fails, that old key
//! remains revoked; the caller must fetch a fresh key.
//!
//! The grant names no agent: agent access is account-scoped, so a credential may pull
//! from any agent's durable in the box account and a change in where an agent resides
//! needs no reissue. `grants::issued_grant` picks the grant from the attested module id:
//! the delivery-authority grant for `prefrontal-core`, the flow-engine grant for
//! `basal`, and the participant grant for every other module. A grant can also name the
//! rooms (the `ck.{acct}.room.{room_id}` subjects) a credential is bound to, but nothing
//! yet tells ck-bus which rooms a module belongs to, so every module is issued with none.
