/// The confirmed-watermark rule, shared by the file and memory stores.
///
/// The watermark for a destination is the highest sequence number `W` such
/// that every record of the local incarnation with a sequence number at or
/// below `W` is settled. Sequence numbers with no record are gaps that belong
/// to other destinations, and never hold the watermark back. The watermark
/// never goes past the highest settled sequence number.
///
/// Records whose outcome the phone holds are pruned as soon as they settle, so
/// the settled sequence numbers above the watermark are also read from the
/// destination's confirmed ranges. Every pruned record is either at or below
/// the stored watermark or inside a confirmed range, so the result is the same
/// as over the unpruned records; open records are never pruned, so it never
/// passes one.
///
/// This is computed from the lowest unsettled sequence number in one pass over
/// the records, so it costs O(records). It must not walk the sequence numbers
/// themselves: those are allocated for the whole phone, not per destination,
/// so they reach the hundreds of thousands while a destination holds a few
/// hundred records, and a walk from 1 made every mutation take seconds.
