//! Revocation: ending a per-process credential ck-bus issued, as NATS state and never as
//! a vault delete.
//!
//! Three ordered steps, each idempotent:
//! 1. Add the user's public key to the `revocations` of the box account JWT (the NATS
//!    account every participant on this box connects under). The account JWT is read
//!    from the server through the claims lookup (the `$SYS` request that returns the
//!    account JWT the server currently holds) immediately before the update, never from
//!    a cache (ck-bus is its single writer). The operator signer (the operator's signing
//!    key listed in the operator JWT, never the operator's root identity key) signs the
//!    updated JWT through `credential.sign`, and the result is pushed over the
//!    claims-update subject of the system user (ck-bus's user in the `$SYS` system
//!    account). The push counts only once the lookup reads back exactly the pushed
//!    token: the server saves a claims update without checking its issuer, so the
//!    update's own reply proves nothing. From then on the server refuses the user's JWT
//!    on every connect, across a server restart, and closes its live connections itself.
//! 2. Delete the module's census key, but only while it still names this credential
//!    (the same generation, epoch and key), as a compare-and-delete on its revision. A
//!    superseded credential's key was already overwritten by its successor, which is
//!    left alone.
//! 3. Kick each live connection of the user over `$SYS`. Connections are known from the
//!    server's connect events (`connections`); one that is already gone is not an
//!    error.
//!
//! Progress is durable (`progress`): a record with step 0 and the inputs is fsynced
//! before step (1), replaced after each step, and removed after step (3). On restart
//! every record resumes at the step after its last completed one. A damaged record is
//! recovered from the census entry for its module: at exactly its (generation, epoch),
//! the inputs are re-derived and the steps replay. An absent, replaced, damaged or
//! unreadable census cannot prove a revocation committed: recovery keeps the damaged
//! record and defers rather than guessing a key or claiming success.
//!
//! What triggers a revocation here: a module fetching a new credential while its census
//! entry names another one. The entry read just before the issue is the superseded
//! credential, whether this process issued it or an earlier ck-bus process did (which is
//! how a restart finds superseded users: the census outlives the process, the in-memory
//! record of issued credentials does not). The other trigger, a census entry whose
//! module has no live process in the supervisor's spawn snapshot (the daemon's list of
//! live module processes and their spawn generations; a missing module means its process
//! exited), belongs to ck-bus's spawn-stream consumer, which calls
//! `Revoker::revoke_module`.
//!
//! JWT expiry is the other half of revocation: every user JWT expires 15 minutes
//! after issue, and a key whose revocation is recorded is never renewed, so a
//! credential whose revocation was lost to damage stays valid for at most 15 minutes.
