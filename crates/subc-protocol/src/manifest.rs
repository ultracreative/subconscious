///   may declare any subset, and omitting an inapplicable field is the honest
///   choice rather than inventing a value to fill it. Populate `build_git_sha`

///   via `option_env!` guarded by the packaging path, or build.rs equivalent)
///   — never from ambient env at an arbitrary consumer compile, which mints a
///   provenance claim from an accident of whoever ran cargo. A builder that
///   can determine whether the tree was clean may declare the sha regardless
///   of whether a release pipeline exists.
/// - Dirty or unstamped builds declare `None` for the affected fields. A
///   populated field stops the reader asking; absent-and-honest beats
///   present-and-best-effort. Absence is reported at two levels with two
///   distinct words: a module that declared no provenance block at all reads
///   `unverifiable`, while an omitted field inside a declared block is
///   dropped from the wire and reads `unavailable`. So omitting a field never
///   costs a module its `Reported` status -- declaration is decided by
///   whether the manifest carried a block, not by which fields it filled.
/// - Dirty-tree stamps are not canonical `build_git_sha` values. A pipeline
///   that emits `-dirty` must omit the affected field rather than pass that
///   stamp to the canonical constructor. Stricter is better: cerebellum's
///   build.rs reports the commit ONLY when the tree was clean, on the argument
///   that dirty bytes match no commit and a precise-looking wrong answer beats
///   absence at being believed.
/// - Two silent-when-wrong checks for any build-rev embedder (CEREB): does
///   the builder know whether the tree was clean, and can its no-git sentinel
///   (source-tarball builds) escape into a field parsed as a sha? Sentinels
///   render as absence, never as a value.
/// - Fill fields FROM THE BUILD only: reading Cargo.lock or the wire crate
///   version inside the manifest constructor describes the source tree
///   sitting beside the running binary, not the binary — the exact claim
///   this struct exists to avoid.
/// - Declare what you KNOW, not blanket-None (WERNI): `store_schema_version`
///   needs no pipeline — any module with a migration list can state its
///   newest migration as fact, and a daemon comparing it against the store's
///   actual version sees a stale-binary mismatch directly. Blanket `None`
///   where a field is knowable wastes the field; blanket-fill where it is
///   not mints a lie. Absence also beats sentinel values (CKCRED): omit the
///   FIELD when BUILD_REV reads a builder sentinel ("unknown", "unavailable",
///   "none", any casing) — publishing the sentinel string as a fact is a
///   well-formed lie shape validation cannot catch. Field omission, not block
///   omission, is the target shape for SDK modules: `wire_crate_version` is a
///   compile-time constant of the linked crate, so a module using the SDK
///   always has at least one honest fact and `build_provenance` reflects that
///   by never returning an absent block. (Block absence remains meaningful on
///   the wire — it reads `unverifiable`, the module made no claim — but it is
///   the shape for non-adopters and proxied manifests, not a target for
///   declarers; see #78.) The hazard in one sentence, for every referent and
///   sentinel case alike: A PRESENT, WELL-FORMED FIELD STOPS THE READER
///   ASKING — a value from the wrong domain and a sentinel from the wrong
///   vocabulary are indistinguishable from a correct value to every check
///   that inspects shape rather than meaning.
/// - PROXIED MANIFESTS STAY None PERMANENTLY (CALLO): a process that
///   forwards another machine's manifest cannot observe that build, and a
///   forwarded provenance claim is indistinguishable on the wire from a
///   verified one — filling it launders an unverifiable assertion. Same
