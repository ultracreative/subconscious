# Changelog

## 0.23.4 — 2026-09-30

- `ModuleHandler::on_draining(reason, deadline)` delivers the daemon's `module.draining` notice,
  which it sends before stopping a module (restart, reload, disable, swap, daemon shutdown). Until
  now the SDK dropped it. The hook runs on its own task, so pings and GOODBYE keep flowing while it
  works, and it is always called before the GOODBYE that ends the drain is handled. `deadline` is
  a wall-clock "no later than", never a grant. It has a no-op default, so existing handlers are
  unaffected. The trait docs describe how to hold a drain open until background work finishes (a
  `Busy` self-signal anchored to health gauges); the `echo-module` example declares one.
- A channel-0 push the SDK cannot decode is ignored, and the first on each connection is logged at
  warn through `tracing` (a new dependency); the connection stays up.

## 0.23.2 — 2026-09-30

- Add `SubcConsumer::open_route_scoped(target, identity, scope, opts)`, which opens (or reuses) a
  managed route admitted under a daemon scope, so a carrier can open its onward route for a
  session and the provider's bind is stamped with the scope. `ScopeSelector` is re-exported from
  `subc-protocol`; build its `owner` with `subc_protocol::Principal`. The managed route cache keys
  a scoped route by the whole selector (owner, ref and epoch): a route opened under one scope or
  epoch is never returned for another, and scoped and unscoped opens never share a route. After
  the route closes, the next call with the same selector reopens it under that selector.
- `scope_not_synced` and `scope_changed` refusals are retried within the call's deadline;
  `scope_ended`, `scope_not_live`, `scope_epoch_required` and `scope_not_carrier` end the call at
  once, with the code in `CallError::route_open_refusal()`. A `route.closed` push with any of the
  four `scope_*` reasons classifies as `RouteCloseDisposition::MustNotReopen`.

## 0.22.1 — 2026-09-29

- `ModuleHandler::on_connection_end(end)` reports how a served module's daemon connection ended:
  `ConnectionEnd::Goodbye` (a channel-0 GOODBYE, a planned stop), `Eof` (closed without one),
  `Reset`, or `Closed` (the module closed it through its `ModuleHandle`). `serve` still returns
  `Ok(())` for all four; the hook is called once, after in-flight requests are cancelled, and
  not when serving ends with an error. It has a no-op default, so existing handlers are
  unaffected.

## 0.22.0 — 2026-09-28

- `DEFAULT_ROUTE_RETRY_DEADLINE` is 90s instead of 30s. A module restart drains its routes (up to
  30s), waits for the old process to stop, then boots the new one; one measured restart kept
  routes refused for 62.5s. The retries still end at `CallOptions::timeout` when that comes
  first, and its default is still 30s, so a caller that wants to ride out a restart raises both.
- Retry delays are jittered ("equal jitter": half of each delay is kept, half is random), so
  routes refused together no longer retry in lock step. `RetryBackoff` is shared by route.open
  retries and reconnects, so reconnect delays are jittered too.
- At most `MAX_ROUTE_OPENS_IN_FLIGHT` (8) route.open requests are outstanding per consumer
  connection, matching the daemon's per-connection limit. Further opens, managed and admitted,
  wait their turn in order, and the wait counts against the same deadline as the open.
- When the retry deadline runs out, `CallError::route_open_refusal()` is the most informative
  refusal seen during the retries instead of the last one: `module_reloading` / `module_warming`
  first, then `delegation_not_registered`, then admission pressure (too many binds in flight),
  then anything else. The error stays `NotSent`. Its message names the refusal's `detail.reason`
  when present, and the most recent refusal after it when that differs.
- Fix a served module that never exited after a channel-0 GOODBYE (for example on
  `supervisor.restart`) until the daemon's stop budget killed it. Requests still in flight held
  the writer open. When the connection ends for any reason (GOODBYE, EOF, reset, close), every
  in-flight request's cancellation token is now cancelled, and requests still waiting for a
  handler slot are dropped.
- The serve future now waits at most 2s for the writer to flush after the connection ends, then
  aborts it, so a handler that ignores cancellation cannot keep the process alive past its stop.
- Add `ModuleHandle::closed()`, a future that resolves once the module's connection has closed,
  so a module can end its own background work, and `ModuleHandle::is_closed()`.

## 0.19.4 — 2026-09-24

- `SpawnStreamError`'s three coded variants carry `body: Box<ErrorBody>` instead of an inline
  `ErrorBody`, so the error stays small when workspace features enlarge `ErrorBody`. Reading
  `body.code` or `body.detail` is unchanged. 0.19.3 was never published.

## 0.19.3 — 2026-09-24

- Add `SubcConsumer::spawn_subscribe`, the typed `supervisor.spawn_subscribe` call on channel 0:
  it takes an optional `SpawnCursor` and returns a `SpawnSubscription` whose `next()` yields each
  `SpawnEvent` until the stream ends. The daemon's two cursor refusals and the terminal it sends a
  subscriber that fell behind come back as `SpawnStreamError::CursorIncarnationMismatch`
  (`spawn_cursor_incarnation_mismatch`, with `current_daemon_incarnation`),
  `SpawnStreamError::CursorTooOld` (`spawn_cursor_too_old`, with `oldest_retained_cursor`) and
  `SpawnStreamError::SubscriberLagged` (`spawn_subscriber_lagged`, with
  `first_undelivered_cursor`), each after every event the daemon queued before it;
  `SpawnStreamError::code()` reads the code. The three codes are exported as constants, and
  `SpawnEvent` and `SpawnEventKind` are re-exported from `subc_client_rs::consumer`.
- Dropping or unsubscribing a channel-0 subscription now sends its Cancel frame, so the daemon
  releases the spawn subscriber. Before, a Cancel was sent only for a subscription on a route.

## 0.19.2 — 2026-09-24

- No library change. The real-daemon tests now start the daemon binary with
  `SUBC_CGROUP_PLACEMENT=disabled`, so they no longer leave cgroups under the caller's own.

## 0.19.1 — 2026-09-24

- Add `SubcConsumer::spawn_snapshot`, the typed `supervisor.spawn_snapshot` call: it returns the
  daemon's `SpawnSnapshot` (live processes with their spawn generations, and the cursor), and a
  daemon refusal as `CallError::Module` with its code. `SpawnSnapshot`, `LiveSpawn` and
  `SpawnCursor` are re-exported from `subc_client_rs::consumer`, so a caller needs no direct
  `subc-control` dependency.

## 0.18.7 — 2026-09-24

- Require subc-protocol 0.25.2. Since 0.18.5 this crate calls
  `error_codes::is_established_route_dead`, which first appears in 0.25.2, but it still accepted
  0.25.0, so a consumer locked at 0.25.0 or 0.25.1 got a compile error instead of an upgrade.

## 0.18.6 — 2026-09-24

- `open_route_with_admission_facts` (and its `_and_options` form) now keeps the daemon's refusal
  code and detail, like the plain route open: read them with `CallError::route_open_refusal()`.
  Before, a refused admitted open became an uncoded `NotSent`, so a caller could not tell
  `module_warming` (retry shortly) from `admission_facts_not_permitted` (configuration).

## 0.18.3 — 2026-09-23

- `PolicyResolver` releases a subject's state once its verdicts expire: expired
  cache entries are removed, and the subject's resolver route is closed and its
  `policy.subscribe` task aborted. Before, both grew with every subject seen.
- Add `PolicyResolver::footprint` and `PolicyResolverFootprint` (entries, held
  routes, running subscription tasks).

## 0.7.2 — 2026-08-24

- Add capability-addressed provider resolution from the catalog capabilities mirror.
- Add deterministic plural resolution, singular ambiguity/unprovided errors, and local identifier validation.
