//! Scope records: owned identity records the daemon holds for sessions.
//!
//! A scope is identified by `(owner, ref)`. The owner is the module whose own
//! registered connection synced it, never a value in the request, and the
//! `ref` is an opaque string unique within that owner only. The design is
//! `docs/designs/daemon-scopes.md`; the wire shapes here are the owner-facing
//! half of it (`scope.sync`, `scope.describe`).
//!
//! Every record type refuses unknown fields. A field this daemon does not know
//! may be one that narrows authority in a later version (a carrier's target
//! list, say), and silently dropping it would widen what the scope grants, so
//! an owner sending one is told its body is malformed instead.
