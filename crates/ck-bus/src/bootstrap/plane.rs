//! What bootstrap does on the broker, behind two traits so the boot sequence can be
//! driven against a recording fake as well as a real `nats-server`.
//!
//! `SystemPlane` is ck-bus's system-account user: the claims list, lookup and update
//! served by the server's full (directory) resolver, the kick, and the connect and
//! disconnect events the kick targets are learned from. `BoxPlane` is ck-bus's
//! box-account user: stream creation, the sentinel subject and the census bucket.
//!
//! A claims update is saved by the server without checking that its issuer is trusted
//! or that its `iat` is newer, so the update's own reply proves nothing about the
//! account the server will load. `apply_account_jwt` therefore reads every push back
//! through the lookup and treats anything but the exact pushed token as not applied.
