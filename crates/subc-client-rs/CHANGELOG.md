# Changelog

## 0.22.0 — 2026-09-28

- `DEFAULT_ROUTE_RETRY_DEADLINE` is 90s instead of 30s. A module restart drains its routes (up to
  30s), waits for the old process to stop, then boots the new one; one measured restart kept
  routes refused for 62.5s. The retries still end at `CallOptions::timeout` when that comes
  first, and its default is still 30s, so a caller that wants to ride out a restart raises both.
- Retry delays are jittered ("equal jitter": half of each delay is kept, half is random), so
  routes refused together no longer retry in lock step. `RetryBackoff` is shared by route.open
  retries and reconnects, so reconnect delays are jittered too.
- At most `MAX_ROUTE_OPENS_IN_FLIGHT` (8) route.open requests are outstanding per consumer
  connection, matching the daemon's per-connection limit. Further opens, managed and admitted,
  wait their turn in order, and the wait counts against the same deadline as the open.
- When the retry deadline runs out, `CallError::route_open_refusal()` is the most informative
  refusal seen during the retries instead of the last one: `module_reloading` / `module_warming`
  first, then `delegation_not_registered`, then admission pressure (too many binds in flight),
  then anything else. The error stays `NotSent`. Its message names the refusal's `detail.reason`
  when present, and the most recent refusal after it when that differs.
- Fix a served module that never exited after a channel-0 GOODBYE (for example on
  `supervisor.restart`) until the daemon's stop budget killed it. Requests still in flight held
  the writer open. When the connection ends for any reason (GOODBYE, EOF, reset, close), every
  in-flight request's cancellation token is now cancelled, and requests still waiting for a
  handler slot are dropped.
- The serve future now waits at most 2s for the writer to flush after the connection ends, then
  aborts it, so a handler that ignores cancellation cannot keep the process alive past its stop.
- Add `ModuleHandle::closed()`, a future that resolves once the module's connection has closed,
  so a module can end its own background work, and `ModuleHandle::is_closed()`.

## 0.19.4 — 2026-09-24

- `SpawnStreamError`'s three coded variants carry `body: Box<ErrorBody>` instead of an inline
  `ErrorBody`, so the error stays small when workspace features enlarge `ErrorBody`. Reading
  `body.code` or `body.detail` is unchanged. 0.19.3 was never published.

## 0.19.3 — 2026-09-24

- Add `SubcConsumer::spawn_subscribe`, the typed `supervisor.spawn_subscribe` call on channel 0:
  it takes an optional `SpawnCursor` and returns a `SpawnSubscription` whose `next()` yields each
  `SpawnEvent` until the stream ends. The daemon's two cursor refusals and the terminal it sends a
  subscriber that fell behind come back as `SpawnStreamError::CursorIncarnationMismatch`
  (`spawn_cursor_incarnation_mismatch`, with `current_daemon_incarnation`),
  `SpawnStreamError::CursorTooOld` (`spawn_cursor_too_old`, with `oldest_retained_cursor`) and
  `SpawnStreamError::SubscriberLagged` (`spawn_subscriber_lagged`, with
  `first_undelivered_cursor`), each after every event the daemon queued before it;
  `SpawnStreamError::code()` reads the code. The three codes are exported as constants, and
  `SpawnEvent` and `SpawnEventKind` are re-exported from `subc_client_rs::consumer`.
- Dropping or unsubscribing a channel-0 subscription now sends its Cancel frame, so the daemon
  releases the spawn subscriber. Before, a Cancel was sent only for a subscription on a route.

## 0.19.2 — 2026-09-24

- No library change. The real-daemon tests now start the daemon binary with
  `SUBC_CGROUP_PLACEMENT=disabled`, so they no longer leave cgroups under the caller's own.

## 0.19.1 — 2026-09-24

- Add `SubcConsumer::spawn_snapshot`, the typed `supervisor.spawn_snapshot` call: it returns the
  daemon's `SpawnSnapshot` (live processes with their spawn generations, and the cursor), and a
  daemon refusal as `CallError::Module` with its code. `SpawnSnapshot`, `LiveSpawn` and
  `SpawnCursor` are re-exported from `subc_client_rs::consumer`, so a caller needs no direct
  `subc-control` dependency.

## 0.18.7 — 2026-09-24

- Require subc-protocol 0.25.2. Since 0.18.5 this crate calls
  `error_codes::is_established_route_dead`, which first appears in 0.25.2, but it still accepted
  0.25.0, so a consumer locked at 0.25.0 or 0.25.1 got a compile error instead of an upgrade.

## 0.18.6 — 2026-09-24

- `open_route_with_admission_facts` (and its `_and_options` form) now keeps the daemon's refusal
  code and detail, like the plain route open: read them with `CallError::route_open_refusal()`.
  Before, a refused admitted open became an uncoded `NotSent`, so a caller could not tell
  `module_warming` (retry shortly) from `admission_facts_not_permitted` (configuration).

## 0.18.3 — 2026-09-23

- `PolicyResolver` releases a subject's state once its verdicts expire: expired
  cache entries are removed, and the subject's resolver route is closed and its
  `policy.subscribe` task aborted. Before, both grew with every subject seen.
- Add `PolicyResolver::footprint` and `PolicyResolverFootprint` (entries, held
  routes, running subscription tasks).

## 0.7.2 — 2026-08-24

- Add capability-addressed provider resolution from the catalog capabilities mirror.
- Add deterministic plural resolution, singular ambiguity/unprovided errors, and local identifier validation.
