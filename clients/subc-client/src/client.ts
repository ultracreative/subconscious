   * answers — subc-core control.rs) and require ANY inbound frame within the
   * window; the Pong suffices, and a busy socket's other traffic proves the
   * link just as well. Silence convicts: the socket is failed with a named
   * cause and closed, so the ordinary drop path (pending rejection now,
   * reconnect on the next call) takes over.
   *
   * Starvation cannot be falsely convicted by a short window: a loop starved
   * enough to delay the read loop delays this probe's own timer identically,
   * and when both wake the buffered Pong dispatches before the check runs.
   *
   * A PENDING CHANNEL-0 REQUEST SUSPENDS THE PROBE (both at launch and at the
   * conviction check). The daemon's connection loop handles frames one at a
   * time, and some channel-0 ops legally park it for seconds — route.open
   * awaits the module's bind ack inline for up to route_bind_relay_timeout
   * (~12s in production) — during which OUR Ping sits unread in the daemon's
   * socket buffer. On an otherwise-quiet connection that silence is fully
   * explained by our own in-flight control op, and convicting on it would
   * tear down a healthy connection mid-bind (BROCA's Athena panel flagged
   * this exact premise; the FIFO fact is verified in subc-core server.rs
   * connection_loop + control.rs handle_route_open). The client always knows
   * its own channel-0 pendings, so the gate is local and exact: no probe
   * while one is in flight, no conviction if one appeared during the window.
   *
   * Scope: hooked from the managed-call path only. Control-plane requests
   * (route.open, catalog.list) are short-lived and their failures already
   * escalate through reconnect classification; the managed path is where a
   * plugin lives for hours and where the pin was observed in production.
