//! The launch nonce: the secret the daemon gives each module it spawns, which
//! the module presents to be admitted as itself.
//!
//! On macOS and Linux the daemon hands it over through a pipe rather than
//! the environment, because any process of the same user can read another
//! process's initial environment (`ps eww`, `sysctl KERN_PROCARGS2`). The
//! daemon side is [`LaunchNonceHandoff`]: a pipe that already holds the nonce,
//! whose read end becomes descriptor [`LAUNCH_NONCE_FD`] in the child. The
//! module side is [`launch_nonce`]: it reads that descriptor once, closes it,
//! and caches the value for the life of the process.
//!
//! While modules move over, the daemon also keeps setting the environment
//! copy ([`LAUNCH_NONCE_ENV`]), and [`launch_nonce`] reads it when no
//! descriptor is named. Windows has no descriptor handoff yet: an inheritable
//! handle there leaks to every process any thread creates concurrently, so
//! Windows keeps the environment copy only.
