# something -- an instrument whose complaints you have learned to dismiss is
# indistinguishable from one that has stopped working.

# So the detail line is remembered between cycles and surfaced only when it is

# THE SHARED DAEMON LOG IS AN INCIDENT-RESPONSE SURFACE, AND ONE SUBSYSTEM CAN

#
# The failure mode: a repeating bind-rejection line can reach tens of percent of
# the whole file at tens of lines per second. The cost is not disk. It is that
# EVERY OTHER SUBSYSTEM'S LINES STOP APPEARING IN THE TAIL -- so a routine "is my
# module alive" check reads the last few hundred lines, sees none of its own, and
# concludes silence. That reads as a dead module, i.e. a false incident report.
# The 200 MB flag and the 20k-line window below are both sized against that: big
# enough not to fire on ordinary volume, small enough to catch a flood early.
#
# WHY THE RATE IS NOT THE LINE COUNT ONCE A RATE LIMIT IS IN PLACE. The emitter's
# fix keeps the message byte-identical and appends "(repeated Nx in last 60s)" to
# the next emission, so THE LINE COUNT COLLAPSES WHILE THE UNDERLYING LOOP
# CONTINUES -- the loop itself only dies as hosts restart onto a client-side
# fix, which is a separate and slower event. Counting lines would report the
# flood solved on the day the counting changed, which is the same trap as a
# metric going to zero because something was renamed.
#
# So this sums suppressed counts and reports THREE distinguishable states,
# because absent and zero are not the same observation:
#   lines, no suffixes   pre-rate-limit; the count IS the rate
#   lines + suffixes     rate limit live; true rate is AT LEAST lines + suffix sum
#   no lines at all      loop dead, OR this check has gone blind -- which the
#                        control below is what separates
#
# THE SUM IS A FLOOR, NOT A TOTAL, and the reason is in the emitter's contract:
# a suppressed count rides on the NEXT emission after its window, so a flood that
# STOPS mid-window never flushes its final count. Suppression is keyed per
# distinct message, so the undercount is bounded by one window per distinct
# message -- with dozens of distinct roots that is not a rounding error. Reported
# as ">=" because a number labelled as a total, that is not one, is the specific
# way a correct measurement turns into a wrong claim.

      # rejects a descriptor whose declared module_id disagrees with its directory
      # name, and builds an `invalid` classification carrying both values. That
      # classification is put in the backup.run reply and NEVER PERSISTED -- the

# Without it the next reader takes a clean result as fleet-wide, which it is not:
# a stale Cloudflare Worker has no local mtime and cannot appear here at all --

# THE UPPER BOUND HAS A MIRROR THAT FAILS THE OTHER WAY, and a module owner found
# it by auditing a clean verdict rather than a noisy one. The path filter excludes
# tests/ and benches/, which is right for a repo that keeps only tests there and
# WRONG for one that keeps runtime code under those paths -- and in the second
# case this section reports clean while real code is unshipped. It cannot be
# fixed from here: whether a file under tests/ ships is a fact about that repo's
# layout, not about its path. The owner who raised it was clean anyway, but only
# because they had deployed that morning -- correct by circumstance rather than
# by coverage, which is precisely what a clean line cannot distinguish.
dim "  a clean line means nothing under tests/ or benches/ was checked -- ask the owner whether runtime code lives there"
# The runtime-file count is an UPPER BOUND, and saying so here is cheaper than
# the alternative. The filter excludes tests/ and benches/ DIRECTORIES, but a
# Rust file commonly carries its tests inline under `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`, and
# a path-based filter structurally cannot see a region defined by an attribute.
# So a commit that only adds an in-file test still counts as an unshipped runtime
# file. Detecting that properly means deciding whether each changed hunk falls
# inside a conditionally-compiled module -- brace matching gets this wrong on
# `#[cfg(test)]` applied to individual items, which is how a filter of that shape
# reads a file as clean while it ships real code.
#
# The second cause is COMMENT-ONLY EDITS, and the reason this section does not try
# to filter them is worth stating rather than leaving as an omission. The obvious
# filter -- strip comment lines, hash the rest, compare -- MEASURES LAYOUT RATHER
# THAN CODE: a formatter re-wraps an expression when the comment above it changes
# length, so a purely documentary commit reads as a code change. Measured on this
# repo: two comment-only commits reported as real, and the tell was that their
# hashes SWAPPED, x -> y then y -> x, which is the signature of a re-wrap and its
# reversal rather than of behaviour. A whitespace-blind normalisation answers
# correctly, but it belongs at the deploy decision where one repo is being
# examined, not in a fleet sweep that would run it over every pending commit.
#
# Over-reporting is the deliberate direction for both causes: a missed stale deploy
# costs far more than a line someone checks and dismisses. But an unstated upper
# bound erodes the section's credibility the first time someone investigates a
# phantom, so the bound is printed rather than remembered.
#
# AND A COMMENT-ONLY COMMIT IS NOT RELIABLY A PHANTOM, which makes the
# over-reporting direction more right than it first appears. Panic sites embed
# their source line numbers into the binary, so inserting comment lines above one
# shifts every later line number and CHANGES THE COMPILED OUTPUT. Measured on a
# sibling repo: a pure-comment commit moved the release hash. So "comments cannot
# reach the binary" is false wherever a panic location or any line-number-bearing
# macro is compiled in -- true only for edits inside `cfg(test)`, which is
# compiled out entirely.
#
# The consequence for a deploy decision: do not dismiss a comment-only commit by
# reading the diff. Build both commits with any embedded build stamp pinned and
# compare artifact hashes. Only equality is conclusive.

# --- engram backup progress -------------------------------------------------
# No durable ROW advances while a generation uploads: `generations` is written
# twice (insert at capture, flip at publish) and nothing in between. The
# per-object counter is the upload sidecar, one object id appended and fsynced
# per confirmed upload -- which is also the resume record, so it is by
# construction the true measure of completed work.
#
# Read it as a RATE, never as a ratio: the file is append-as-you-go, so the
# denominator is not final until published=1.
#
# The observation window must be sized against the SLOWEST rate that still counts
# as progress, not the fastest. An earlier version sampled 30s and declared a
# stall on a zero delta, which was sound at the ~20/min rate it was written
# against -- and cried wolf the first time a generation ran at ~3/min, where a
# 30s window expects fewer than two objects and a zero is ordinary. A false stall
# is expensive twice: it costs an investigation, and it teaches the reader to
# discount the one signal that would matter during a real one.
#
# So a zero window EXTENDS rather than concludes. Only sustained zero across the
# long window is a stall, and a restart is safe then -- it costs the in-flight
# object and resumes from the sidecar.
#
# Written after five store tables all read "unchanged" and all five turned out to
# have zero rows: they belong to a subsystem with no live session on this box.
