//! The daemon's scope table.
//!
//! A scope is an owned identity record for a session, keyed `(owner, ref)`. The
//! owner is the module whose own registered connection synced it; the daemon
//! never takes the owner from a request body. Everything here is in memory and
//! starts empty in every daemon incarnation: owners re-sync after a restart and
//! readers hold until they do (`docs/designs/daemon-scopes.md`, sections 2, 3,
//! 5 and 6).
//!
//! The table is pure state. The control handler decides who the syncing owner
//! is and whether its connection belongs to the owner's current launch, and
//! passes both in, so every rule below can be exercised without a socket.
//!
//! Route admission ([`ScopeTable::admit`]) reads the table and returns the stamp
//! for the bind and the tag it was taken at. A sync reports each scope whose
//! `(scope_epoch, version)` it changed ([`ScopeTagChange`]), with which live
//! routes the change closes ([`ScopeDrain`]), so the caller publishes the tags
//! into the forwarding table and closes those routes in the same step: a bind
//! commit compares its captured tag against the published one and must never
//! take the scope lock.
