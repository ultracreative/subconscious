//! How long a user JWT ck-bus issues lives, and when its holder renews it (R16).
//!
//! Every user JWT carries `exp` 15 minutes after its `iat`. Its holder renews it 10
//! minutes after issue, plus a few seconds of per-process jitter so the processes on one
//! machine do not all ask ck-bus to sign in the same instant. Renewal re-signs the same
//! user key with a fresh `iat` and `exp`; the connection keeps running on the old JWT
//! until nats-server disconnects it at that JWT's `exp`, and the reconnect that follows
//! presents the renewed one. The 15 minutes is also how long a user whose revocation was
//! lost to damage stays valid.
//!
//! The acceptance rows cannot wait 15 minutes, so a debug build (what `cargo test`
//! runs) reads a shorter lifetime from `CKBUS_TEST_USER_JWT_LIFETIME_MS` and
//! `CKBUS_TEST_USER_JWT_RENEW_AFTER_MS`. A release build never reads them: the lifetime
//! of a shipped ck-bus is always the one written here.
