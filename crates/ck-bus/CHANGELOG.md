# Changelog

## 0.3.6

- `install-apply --conf-only` takes two new flags, which `ck setup` uses to upgrade an existing install. `--keep-existing` keeps a monitoring listener that is already on another port: it reports `"status": "kept"` and a `health_url` for that port instead of refusing, and it cannot be combined with `--monitor-port`. `--dry-run` writes nothing and reports `"would apply"` where a write would happen. Without these flags, behaviour is unchanged. A non-loopback listener is still refused under every flag.

## 0.3.5

- Update the test daemon dependency to subc-daemon 0.32 whose macOS launches give each supervised module its own privacy identity.

## 0.3.4

- `install-apply` enables loopback-only NATS HTTP monitoring (`--monitor-port`, default 18222), refuses a collision with the client port, and reports the plain `/healthz` URL for daemon health probes. `--conf-only` upgrades the monitoring line in an existing rendered `server.conf` without rewriting JWTs, keys or resolver data, preserving its mode and leaving identical configurations untouched.

## 0.3.3

- Updates the SDK, daemon and wire dependency cascade for subc-protocol 0.29.0 (`ToolCallRequest.preset` and `ScopeAttributes.flow_id`), a release breaking for Rust struct literals. No other behavior change.

## 0.3.2

- A credential census read interrupted by a reconnect of ck-bus's own bus connection is replayed instead of timing out, within the same five-second budget. A census that cannot be read for any other reason (its stream is missing, or the broker returns an error or no reply in time) still makes the issuance fail with `ckbus_census_unavailable`; it is never treated as an absent entry.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-02

- Update Rust client and control dependencies to 0.25 and 0.27 for per-route close reasons and channel-addressed lifecycle pushes.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-10-01

- Takes `subc-protocol` 0.28.0, whose `ToolCallRequest` gains an `origin` field (see that crate's changelog), and the matching minor releases of the crates built on it: `subc-client-rs` 0.24, `subc-control` 0.26, `subc-transport` 0.9 and `subc-daemon` 0.27. No other change (a test sets the new `role_versions` route.open field to `None`).
