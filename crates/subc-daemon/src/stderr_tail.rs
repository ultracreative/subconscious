//! Bounded per-module stderr capture.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `last_exit_code` survives a respawn because the supervisor holds it in memory.
//! Stderr had no such path: it went to the daemon's inherited fd, and from there
//! to whatever rotates or evicts it. On the box this was written for, that window
//! was about three hours; on another it was bounded by a log file reaching 908 MB
//! with one module accounting for 98% of it. Two hosts, two mechanisms, the same
//! outcome -- the text explaining a crash is gone by the time anyone asks.
//!
//! So this keeps the last few lines where `last_exit` already lives: in supervisor
//! memory, immune to whatever happens to the log.
//!
//! # What it is not
//!
//! Not a log. The ring is deliberately small and lossy, and callers are expected
//! to know they are reading a tail rather than a history. The daemon log keeps
//! doing its job; this exists because that job has a time limit.
