//! The live-children record and the boot-time orphan sweep.
//!
//! Supervised modules lead their own process groups (see `spawn_child_in_slot`),
//! so when the daemon dies without running its shutdown stop (a crash, an OOM
//! kill, SIGKILL) nothing ends the children that do not exit on EOF: every
//! `protocol: "none"` child, which has no connection to see EOF on, and any
//! module that ignores it. The next daemon would then start fresh copies
//! beside them, fighting over ports and stores.
//!
//! So the daemon keeps a record, in its run directory, of every child in its
//! roster: rewritten whole (temp file, then rename) on each admit and release,
//! so a reader only ever sees a complete record. At boot, before any module is
//! spawned, [`sweep_orphans`] reads the previous daemon's record and ends every
//! listed process that is still the process that was recorded.
//!
//! "Still the process that was recorded" is three checks, and a process that
//! fails any of them is never signalled: the pid, the kernel's start time for
//! it (a reaped pid can be reused by an unrelated process, which then has a
//! later start time), and the device and inode of the image it is executing
//! (which catches a reuse inside one start-time tick). The start time and
//! image come from the `subc-os` crate, the only place those reads need unsafe
//! code. On macOS, `/bin/sh` is a launcher that re-execs its selected shell;
//! when recording that image, also retain the selected interpreter's identity.
//! Matching never resolves the shell selection again after a crash or upgrade.
//!
//! On Windows the sweep signals nothing: the daemon's job object already ends
//! a crashed daemon's children, and the record is read only to log it.
