 * The launch nonce: the secret the daemon gives each module it spawns, which

 *
 * On macOS and Linux the daemon hands it over through a pipe rather than the
 * environment, because any process of the same user can read another
 * process's initial environment (`ps eww`). The pipe's read end is descriptor
 * 3 in the module and `SUBC_LAUNCH_NONCE_FD` names it as `<fd>:<inode>`.
 * {@link launchNonce} reads that descriptor once, closes it, and caches the
 * value for the life of the process. While modules move over, the daemon also
 * keeps setting the environment copy (`SUBC_LAUNCH_NONCE`), which
 * {@link launchNonce} reads when no descriptor is named. Windows has no
 * descriptor handoff, so there only the environment copy is read.
 *
 * This mirrors the Rust accessor in `subc-os` (`subc_os::launch_nonce`): the
 * same checks in the same order, the same error names and messages.

 *
 * The first call decides, and every later call returns the same answer
 * without touching the descriptor or the environment again. So every reader
 * in a process must come through here: after the first read closes the
 * descriptor, its number is the next one the process hands out, and a second
 * independent reader would read and close some unrelated socket or file. The
 * cache is shared with every other copy of this package loaded in the same
 * JavaScript realm (see {@link PROCESS_CELL_KEY}); a worker thread is its own
 * realm and has its own cache, so read it on the main thread.
 *
 * - When `SUBC_LAUNCH_NONCE_FD` is set (not on Windows), the descriptor it
 *   names is taken only if it is a pipe with the named inode and holds bytes;
 *   it is then read to end of file and closed. Anything else throws and leaves
 *   the descriptor as it was, and never falls back to the environment.
 * - Otherwise the value of `SUBC_LAUNCH_NONCE` is used.
 *
 * It never changes `process.env`. Removing either variable would break any
 * other reader in the process still on the environment copy.
 *
 * Call it before the process spawns anything. Until the first read the
 * descriptor is inheritable (it has to be, to survive the daemon's exec), so a
 * child spawned earlier would inherit the pipe.
 *
 * It assumes the write end of the pipe was closed before this process started,
 * as the daemon's handoff does. Node and Bun cannot ask how many bytes a pipe
 * holds without reading it (the Rust accessor uses the FIONREAD ioctl), so the
 * emptiness check is a first read: at end of file it returns no bytes and
 * consumes nothing. If some other process still held the write end open, an
 * empty pipe would block that read instead of reporting `Empty`.
