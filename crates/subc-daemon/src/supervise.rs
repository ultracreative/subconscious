/// What a failed health probe actually OBSERVED, kept apart from how it reads.

/// This was a struct with a single `message: String`, and every one of the
/// fifteen construction sites collapsed into it. Each site knows exactly what it
/// saw -- the lane is gone, the module did not answer in time, the module
/// answered with the wrong thing -- and `handle_health_probe_failure` then
/// treated all of them identically: increment a counter, compare to a threshold,
/// restart the module. THE DISTINCTION EXISTED AT EVERY CALL SITE AND WAS
/// DESTROYED BEFORE THE DECISION THAT NEEDED IT.
///
/// The distinction that matters is not severity, it is EVIDENTIAL WEIGHT:
///
/// * `LaneDead` is PROOF. The module's control connection is gone; nothing will
///   answer on it again.
/// * `NoAnswer` is ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE. It is consistent with a wedged module
///   AND with a perfectly healthy one that lost a CPU race -- which is what
///   happens under machine load, and is how this supervisor killed a healthy
///   module three times in one day.
/// * `BadAnswer` proves the module is ALIVE. It replied; the reply was wrong.
///   Restarting on it is defensible, but it is not the silence case and should
///   never be counted as one.
/// * `Misconfigured` is a daemon-side fault. The module has not been asked
///   anything, so it cannot be evidence about the module at all.
///
/// The asymmetry is the whole point: under saturation the WEAKEST signal is the
/// one that fires most often, and while every variant collapsed into one string
/// it carried the same weight as the strongest.
///
/// LIVE BEHAVIOUR TODAY, stated here because this doc block describes the
/// DESIGN and a reader stopping at it gets the build backwards: the restart
/// decision does NOT yet consult this classification -- consecutive `NoAnswer`
