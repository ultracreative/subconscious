//! subc wire contract.
//!
//! This crate is the single source of truth for the subc <-> module wire,
//! shared by subc-core and AFT. It defines the **envelope** (the fixed
//! 21-byte routing header subc splices on), the canonical subc-generated body
//! schemas such as [`ErrorBody`], and the capability manifest. JSON-RPC request
//! and response bodies remain module-owned opaque payloads to subc.
//!
//! ## The envelope (locked — see docs/subc-core-architecture.md §4.8)
//!
//! ```text
//!  offset  size  field     type    purpose
//!    0      4    len       u32     # of BODY bytes after this 21-byte header
//!    4      1    ver       u8      envelope version
//!    5      1    type      u8      frame kind (see FrameType)
//!    6      1    flags     u8     bit0 BINARY · bits1-2 PRIORITY · bit3 LAST · bits4-5 ADMISSION · bit6 DAEMON_ORIGIN · bit7 SUBSCRIPTION
//!    7      2    channel   u16     route = (component, session); 0 = subc itself
//!    9      4    epoch     u32     per-slot binding epoch; 0 on channel 0
//!   13      8    corr      u64     correlation id; CANCEL carries the target call's corr
//!   21 -> body
//! ```
//!
//! Little-endian (same-machine, native, no byte-swap on the hot path).
//!
//! **Frozen prefix (the versioning invariant):** `len` (u32 @ 0) and `ver`
//! (u8 @ 4) keep fixed meaning + position in *every* future version. A reader
//! of any version can therefore always read the first 5 bytes, learn `ver`,
//! look up that version's header length, read the rest, and splice `len` body
//! bytes. `decode_header` enforces this discipline.
